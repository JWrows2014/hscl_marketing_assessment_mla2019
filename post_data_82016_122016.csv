World AIDS Day began in 1988, and was the first ever global health day.

In recognition of this, we would like to present a collection of videos we have co-created with the University of Florida's Center for Arts In Medicine. 

This series consists of four videos:

'Stop Signs' - a short, spoken word piece about preventing the contraction and transmission of HIV/AIDS. 

'HIV / AIDS - Knowledge Is Power' - which explores current perceptions and myths related to HIV / AIDS in Gainesville and North Central Florida, and provides local and national resources for testing and additional information. 

'HIV Over 50' - Did you know that over half the people living with HIV in Florida are over 50? 'HIV Over 50' explores this and other facts and perceptions in the over 50 community, and provides information and resources to learn more. 

'Let's Talk About It - Rural Women's Health Project' - a video highlighting the work of the Rural Women's Health Project, a non-profit organization that designs and implements community-based health-education projects, promotes lay-health worker efforts and develops community-driven materials to assist communities in strengthening their understanding of critical health and community issues. 

We encourage you to watch, learn and share these videos as a way to raise awareness and as a positive action to recommit ourselves to ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat. 

This project was funded by The National Library of Medicine, HIV/AIDS Community Information Outreach Project, PO # HHSN276201500702P, and made possible with support from a UF Creative Campus Catalyst Fund Grant (Office of the Provost).

When: November 7th 12-12:50 PM

This talk highlights his own involvement in the creation of treatment regimens that helped to change HIV infection from a fatal to long term chronic infection.  During his work with the NIH in the late 1980s and 1990s, Dr Deyton established “groundbreaking community-based programs for clinical AIDS research at NIH that helped an under-served population that was being devastated at the beginning of the epidemic.”  During this time “he helped lead more than 200 NIH-funded clinical trials of new HIV therapeutics”… and “he brought thousands of patients with HIV/AIDS in the clinical trials that had previously been excluded, including African Americans, drug users and those with little or no access to health care.”  https://servicetoamericamedals.org/honorees/view_profile.php?profile=268 

Biography: Lawrence Deyton, MD, MSPH is Senior Associate Dean for Clinical Public Health at George Washington University School of Medicine (where he received his MD in 1985), currently teaching and working on incorporating public health initiatives into the medical school curriculum there.  He trained as an infectious disease specialist focusing on caring for and treating individuals with HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, working on developing the ART regimen for treating HIV/AIDS.  He has had 30 years of experience in federal public health, health policy, health system administration, and clinical research, including being a founder of the Whitman Walker Clinic, dedicated to treating LGBT patients and now to HIV/AIDS treatment.  He has worked for the federal government developing tobacco cessation programs.  His work as the first Director of the Center for Tobacco Products at the US FDA led to the implementation of the family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. He also served as chief public health and environmental hazards office for the US Department of Veterans Affairs, and held leadership positions in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health and Human Services.

Our liaisons are librarians who specialize in a particular subject and who work with specific colleges, departments, centers or programs. Your liaison librarian is the first person you can call when you need help finding, selecting, or managing information.

Our liaisons are experts at searching databases of research data and literature, managing citations, creating data management plans, assisting with systematic reviews, and more! Your liaison can meet with you one-on-one, come guest lecture in your class, create tutorials that you can share online, or partner with your team on grants, publications, or research projects. #NationalLibraryWeek
